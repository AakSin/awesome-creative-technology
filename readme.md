# Awesome Creative Technology Groups [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> Curated list of Creative Technology groups, companies, studios, collectives, etc.

Creative technology is a broadly interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary field combining computing, design, art and the humanities.

Creative technologists by definition have a breadth of skills, as opposed to a specific specialty â€” so it's difficult to categorize them. While this isn't a perfect organization, each group below generally specializes in the area to which they've been assigned.
