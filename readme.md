# Awesome Creative Technology Groups [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> Curated list of Creative Technology groups, companies, studios, collectives, etc.

Creative technology is a broadly interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary field combining computing, design, art and the humanities.

This list hopes to compile the best creative technology groups across the world, both as reference and as potential employers to creative technologists.

Creative technologists by definition have a breadth of skills as opposed to a specific specialty, so it's difficult to categorize them. While this isn't a perfect organization, each group below generally specializes in the area to which they've been assigned.
