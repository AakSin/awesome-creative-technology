# Awesome Creative Technology Groups [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> Curated list of Creative Technology groups, companies, studios, collectives, etc.

Creative technology is a broadly interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary field combining computing, design, art and the humanities.

This list hopes to compile the best creative technology groups across the world, both as a source of inspiration and as a reference point for potential employers of creative technologists.

Creative technologists by definition have a breadth of skills as opposed to a specific specialty, so it's difficult to categorize them. While this isn't a perfect organization, each group below generally specializes in the area to which they've been assigned.
